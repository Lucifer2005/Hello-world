"""In this program, swap_chars is a function that takes a string s as input. 
If the length of the string is less than 2, it returns the string as it is. 
Otherwise, it returns a new string where the first character is s[-1] (the last character of s),
the middle part is s[1:-1] (the second to second-last characters of s), and the last character is s[0] (the first character of s). 
The + operator then concatenates these parts into one string."""
